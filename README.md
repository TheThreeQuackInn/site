# The Three Quack Inn
Welcome to the Three Quack Inn, an inn dedicated to adventurers and storytellers alike. Come sit by the warm fires, eat until your belly is full and sleep like a king in ours beds. 

The Three Quack Inn helps Gamemasters and players with tools to use in their games. Only a few tools are available right now, but I plan on releasing more features.

## About
The website uses the following stack:
- React for the frontend in general
- NextJS for the landing page
- Works with yarn workspaces and lerna to create separate packages for subapps
- In the future, GraphQL will be added along with prisma.io
- Also, exploring AWS Lambda is on the list

## Semantic release
Semantic release is enabled across the monorepo and should be enforced by Husky. Follow the steps presented when committing.
